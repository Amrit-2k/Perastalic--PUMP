# Perastalic Pump
 
A project based on Perastalic pump's program. 



This project required me is to use LCD to veiw information of perastalic pump's functions.
The buttons were used to navigate through different menu options.




Perastalic Pump has two main functions  pump and dose. These function had variables like speed, volume and direction. These variables are configured with three buttons that allows user to change pump speed, volume of the liquid pumped and rotation direction. 



A stepper Motor is used to pump liquid. TMC2130 driver was required in my project for motor to work.
