# Perastalic Pump
 
A project based on Perastalic pump's program. 



This project required me to use LCD to veiw see functions of perastalic pump.
The buttons were used to navigate through different menu options.




Perastalic Pump has two main functions "pump and dose". These function had variables like speed, volume and direction that determined the functions. These variables are configured with three buttons that allows user to change pump speed, volume of the liquid pumped and rotation direction. 



A stepper Motor is used to pump liquid so therefore TMC2130 driver was required for it to work.
